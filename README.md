Learning to deploy a FastAPI application (packaged as a microservice) into production DigitalOcean App Platform. This extracts any and all text from images using a technique called OCR.

Here's a list of the packages I have used to accomplish this:

- FastAPI
- Tesseract OCR
- pytesseract
- pytest
- Gunicorn
- Uvicorn
- Requests
- Docker
- and more
